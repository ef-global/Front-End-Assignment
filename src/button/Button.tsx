// We would like you to build an accessible, typed button component which:
//
// 1. Forwards its ref to the actual dom element it returns.
//
// 2. Has the following props:
//      - variant<string>: Defines the button style to show, there are two variants, as depicted in 'buttons.png':
//          - 'primary' - the primary button style
//          - 'secondary' - the secondary button style
//
// 3. Also accepts any other props of a regular HTML button, such as disabled, and also any additional classNames.
//
// 4. Can have text and icons as content as depicted in buttons.png. Please use the provided umbrella svg for the icon.
//
// 5. Can be easily themed with a brand colour other than blue.
//
// Notes:
// We are using css modules in this project, so you can add styles from the button module file with styles[className] - https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules
// You may add any helper libraries you need

export const Button = () => {};
